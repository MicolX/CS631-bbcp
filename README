*** Explanation ***

This program 'bbcp' would read the content of the source file
and then write the content it just read into the target file, until all the content of the 
source file have been read.

*******************


*** Limitations ***

The program only accepts two parameters.
The source file can ONLY be a regular file.
The target file can ONLY be either a regular file or a directory.
